##Team AES Milestone 3
###Functionality
This build has 3 main functions. The first function is displaying all of the users shoes. The second function of this build is the ability to sort the users shoes by the current market price (high/low). Finally, the user can click each individual shoe to see some more info about it (size, retail price, and net gain/loss).

###User Stories
The 2 main user stories that were addressed in this build were user stories were 1 and 5 from Milestone 1. User story 1 is displaying all of the users shoes, and user story 5 is sorting the users shoe list by market value.

###Design Decisions/Challenges
Implementing the design for the 2 user stories covered in this build didn't present any major design challenges, so there were no major design changes when compared to the design doc. The user still has a list of shoes, with options to sort by market value, and the user can still view info on individual shoes.
